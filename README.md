# TestCLARepo
This TestCLARepo is used each time we test that the CLA mechanism is working fine in PROD. At that time, we make it public, as any other repo in the public area and we do the test with a pull request and if ok, we put the repo back to private so that it is not visible by everyone like other real “live” repositories.
Please do not delete it.
